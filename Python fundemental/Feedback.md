### Project Feedback + Evaluation

For all projects, students will be evaluated on a simple 4 point scale (0, 1, 2, or 3). Instructors will use this rubric when scoring student performance on each of the core project **requirements:** 

Score | Expectations
----- | ------------
**0** | _Does not meet expectations. Try again._
**1** | _Meets expectations. Good job._
**2** | _Meets expectations. Great job._
**3** | _Surpasses expectations. Brilliant!_

| Requirement                                           | Rubric |
|-------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| Command of basic Python data structures               |      3 |
| Command of basic Python syntax and control flow       |      2 |
| Comfort with calculating basic descriptive statistics |      3 |



__Qualitative feedback:__
1. Time management regarding the presentation needs to be addressed however excellent coverage of the area. Extensive domain knowledge can make it difficult to summarise.
2. Finding more opportunities to practice list comprehension moving forward will make it easier.
3. Further code specific feedback will be shared 1:1 upon request.
