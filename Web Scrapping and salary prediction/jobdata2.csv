It is integration-enabling: designed around collaboration and information sharing, enabling connected and integrated responses to clients across government agencies and non-government partners; and

152,Account Director,Brisbane QLD,,Sterning,,"$95,000 - $110,000 a year","One of Brisbane's leading integrated communications businesses and they are looking for highly talented Account Director to join it established team.
Brisbane
$95,000 — $110,000
This is a great opportunity to join one of Australia's finest communications agency and to help direct one if its finest and most loyal clients. You might currently be working as client lead in an integrated, digital or media agency

From brief to final delivery, it is your responsibility to lead the clients and agency team to deliver the very best work which will deliver against the client brief, creating an environment of motivation, inspiration, trust and partnership.

Beyond managing the projects, you should be leading the clients, driving the agency agenda. This is built through a deep strategic partnership with clients, where they always want your point of view because they know you understand their business as well as them. You should always be asking the right questions and doing your homework to ensure you have a robust understanding of the client’s business, its strengths/weaknesses/opportunities/threats, as well the motivations of the clients themselves so you know how to best frame the work.

The Account Director should ensure that the client interaction with the Agency should be the high point of their day, and can leave them feeling stretched, even challenged at times, but always constructively so, based on building to a shared goal not individual disparate agendas.

You should always do what's right for the work and sometimes that means having the difficult conversations - whether that's on the brief, on creative feedback, timings or budget but based on your knowledge of their business and their personal motivations, you know how best to do this and have built up the trust that will make this easier.


Making it happen

You are responsible for the delivery of all projects on brief, on time and in budget - at the very best quality.

You are responsible for ensuring you have access to the right skills to deliver. You should get to know what the Client offering is within the different group capabilities, why it could be relevant to your Client and who the discipline experts are within our those capabilities. Be collaborative to ensure a seamless integration of skills, all working for the same thing - the work.

You are responsible for getting client approval on all aspects of production. That requires thinking ahead, ensuring clients are clear on what needs to happen when and therefore setting the right conditions to drive the agency agenda and getting to the best output.

At Account Director level we expect you to demonstrate a sound strategic understanding and insight into your client’s business, its competitors, the broader category and its customers. You should have a point of view on what is right for their business (not just what the clients want) bringing a fresh perspective to the table. You should be able to present strategic thinking with clarity, often leading the conversation both internally and with clients. Your planner will not always be in the room, so you should learn not to be overly reliant on them for their point of view.

Some of the desirable skills and experience

Account Directors should be capable at writing good creative briefs for smaller projects, always with an insightful 'did you know' that can frame the challenge.
You should start to lead the longer term view, having a point of view about what the approach should be beyond the current projects in order to deliver against the client's objectives.
You set roles, responsibilities and lead your particular silo team on a day-to-day basis, mentoring and coaching as appropriate. You play an important role in keeping everyone motivated - not only in account management but also planning, creative, data and production.
Inspire high standards throughout – both internally and in all aspects of client service. You should provide positive leadership in all situations, especially the difficult ones.
You ensure you have the flexibility of style between orchestrating, facilitating or driving a team and knowledge of when each style will help to meet the end goal.
Nurture and develop junior talent including performance appraisals and encouraging productive career conversations, including the setting and regular reviews of objectives. This approach should empower the team to become self-aware, self-motivated and inspired to do their very best.
Demonstrate the ability to manage individuals (both senior and junior) and their workloads to get the best from them.
You are responsible overall for delivering campaigns on brief, on time and on budget - delegating work effectively to the wider team taking into account individuals skills and development needs.
The Account Director should show a clear understanding of the financial status on the account at all times and have a point of view on why that's the case, and whether there is work to be done to improve it. This should cover scope, margin, profitability and revenue.
You should be able to accurately forecast and ensure members of you team have contributed to and understand the targets set for live and upcoming projects.
You should own the budgets of all projects and be able to troubleshoot, including being able to manage these across multiple channels and group capabilities. You should also contribute to good financial management of the business, improving profitability and maximising revenue, always looking for better ways of doing things.You should ensure the team is following all financial rules and regulations, both internal and external as well as any client agreed processes.

A little bit about us
The Strategic Policy Branch is the central policy hub within the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Cities & Regional Development, advising key Ministers and the Department’s Senior Executive Board on whole-of-Department Policy priorities. The Strategic Policy Branch function has three arms – a Departmental Strategy Unit, a Policy Project Unit and a Cities and Infrastructure Economic Policy Unit.
The opportunities we have available
APS5, APS6 and EL1 Cities, Infrastructure and Population - Economic policy
We are seeking outstanding public economists who want to be involved in the development of national cities, transport, infrastructure and regional policy within the Australian Government. We are flexible about the level. In the end, we want the best people and we will adjust the role and level to accommodate the person (not the other way around).
What will you do?
You will be developing policy advice end-to-end – from economic theory to evidence to sharp written advice and visuals. Your work begins with consideration of the economic framework that underpins the policy area (e.g. cities, housing, infrastructure, transport etc). Next you will marshal the evidence, including analysing relevant data and drawing on relevant research. You will also consult and learn from experts in the policy area before presenting your findings and recommendations at our economic policy forums. These are an opportunity for the team to test ideas and bring their skills to bear on interesting policy questions. Finally, you will draft written advice for Ministers including charts and other visuals.
The role provides an opportunity to learn the following skills:
High level economic theory and its application to real world policy advice
Analysing economic data to support policy change
Verbal presentation skills and the capability to create compelling visuals
Economic writing, including writing with precision about quantitative or economic concepts
Engagement with expert networks for input, advice and assistance across the Department and broader Commonwealth Government.
Who are we looking for?

The following core capabilities are key to this role:

Intellectual Curiosity – you need to be analytical and empirical in your thinking and apply an economic framework to your policy advice. We will help you get the tools, but you need the intellectual curiosity and discipline to get results.
Relentless pursuit of human capital - you need to be focussed and disciplined to master economics, analysis and policy advising. We will give you the opportunity to acquire the needed skills and human capital, but you need to put in the effort.
A love of sharp communication – you need to be able to convey your logic and evidence clearly and succinctly. Our end product is policy advice; it needs to be short, sharp and persuasive. That means honing your writing, your presenting and your visuals. We take the look, feel and style of our advisory products seriously, not just the economic content.
Acts with integrity – you need to engage with stakeholders in good faith, always do your best and take a genuine interest in helping out in the team. The team will also be there for you when you need it.
Eligibility requirements
Employment with the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Cities and Regional Development is subject to conditions prescribed within the Public Service Act 1999 including:
Citizenship : To be eligible for employment with the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Cities and Regional Development, applicants must be an Australian citizen. Only in exceptional circumstances will the department consider waiving this requirement.
Health Assessment : The preferred applicant may be required to undergo a medical examination conducted by the department’s preferred medical provider.
Security Clearance : The successful candidate must be able to obtain and/or maintain a security clearance at Baseline Vetting Level.
