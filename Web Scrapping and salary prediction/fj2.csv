As the Internet of Things (Io T)  grows more prominent, and technology becomes ever more embedded in everyday life, the challenge becomes more pressing to ensure that this technological revolution is harnessed in ways that enhance liveability as much as possible. Monash University, in collaboration with Monash City Council, aims to be a part of the solution, with i Sense Oakleigh – an integrated smart city precinct underpinned by advanced sensoring technologies and a data communications network.

This is an incredibly exciting project using existing technology in a new way. The network provides an Io T connected platform to sense, collect and analyse relevant data to improve liveability for the community within the precinct. The sensors and its platform will collect and fuse different data on mobility including vehicles, bicycles and pedestrians, as well as improve utilisation of public spaces such as on-street and off-street parking. Once captured, this data will be used in practical applications that will increase levels of service and efficiency, and ultimately greatly enhance the community.

The Research Fellow will focus on researching and creating novel prototype software to support the project. This will include working with the Chief Investigators Professor John Grundy and Professor Hai Vu; the Solution Architect; the technology providers; and MCC staff; to identify new council employee, business organisation and/or citizen digital solution requirements and designs, and help to identify and assess potential architectures and platforms that could be used for project solutions. These solution designs will: 

Leverage the i Sense Oakleigh smart city sensors, interactors, platform and data
Prototype solutions that fuse available smart city data to support traffic management, pedestrians, businesses and council operations
Use data analytics to find and understand patterns and amalgamate diverse sensor data; and
Present this information and knowledge obtained to end users in visual forms using mobile apps and/or web pages

Technology is an ever-more central and ubiquitous part the human experience, and it constantly changes the way we live our lives, for better or worse. One of the highest priorities of the Monash University’s fast-growing, world-class Faculty of IT is to consistently be at the forefront of innovative research into how technology can be used for good social outcomes.

As part of this ongoing mission, the newly launched Artificial Intelligence for Law Enforcement and Community Safety (Ai LECS)  research lab is proud to announce an opening for a committed and dedicated Research Fellow to join our expanding team!

The Ai LECS lab is a joint initiative of Monash University and the Australian Federal Police, and we investigate how the ethical use of AI and machine learning can assist with accelerating the investigation and prosecution of heinous crimes such as child exploitation and terrorism. This is an incredibly important research area, as exposure to the material associated with such areas can cause significant psychological trauma for police officers and the judiciary.

The Australian-first Ai LECS lab focuses on: 

Explainable algorithms and auditable performance techniques (important for judicial use and public accountability) 
Illicit image and video machine learning classification algorithms
Image localisation
Scalable near duplicate image detection techniques
Techniques for leveraging massive law enforcement datasets
A crucial part of this work has been access to real case data for training machine learning algorithms. Due to its illegal and disturbing nature, a “data airlock” server architecture has been developed in the lab allowing tightly controlled access in such a way that researchers can train algorithms without being exposed to the raw data.

Watch how this research creates better social outcomes.

About you: 

We are seeking an outstanding qualified researcher to join our team. Ideally you will have worked in machine learning with deep neural networks for image classification or other relevant experience. The Ai LECS lab has a focus on the rapid operationalisation of research work into technologies for integration with law enforcement systems. There is also a strong emphasis in the lab on international collaboration.

Additionally, any experience with the following will be highly regarded: 

Machine learning (image classification a bonus!) 
Extensive coding experience (particularly Python/.NET Core) 
A focus on applied research
If you are enthusiastic at the prospect of taking on an important and ground-breaking challenge that does demonstrable social good, we strongly encourage you to apply!

Once the budget allocation is defined, it then proceeds to tactical deployment of funds across the selected channels to ensure target market optimisation to set the stage for everything that follows.The second act is to create design elements specifically tailored to each of the channels to ensure optimal conversions while providing coherent maximum brand reinforcement. The collaboration and synchronisation of media and creative design is one of the reasons UEC out-performs its peers as well as internal marketing departments.The third act builds on this momentum to integrate lead generation and client acquisition activities to feed into a cohesive customer journey that provides a higher conversion on their path to purchase. This is enabled with sophisticated automated workflows that create and enhance the customer experience, reducing attrition at or immediately following a purchase as well as substantially improving customer satisfaction during the consumption of the product or service. This inevitably reduces operational costs. Even though UEC is focused on media, sales and marketing, the systemisation of multiple customer journeys translates into organisational improvements that further create benefits with economies of scale. These improvements often provide the much-needed capacity to grow quickly without substantial additional and costly human resources.The last act builds to a crescendo by embracing leading-edge technologies including:  artificial intelligence, machine learning, heuristics, predictive modelling and data analytics to fully embrace the concept of deliberate practice principles that have created Olympic medallists and World Champions. This complex process involves creating a self-reinforcing feedback loop that automatically and systematically applies highly sophisticated mathematics and statistical techniques to optimise all the moving components, so we can manage, monitor and adjust each variable in harmony with the others to maximise profits at the minimum cost while sustaining the highest quality and brand integrity.Job Types:  Full-time, Part-time, Contract, Permanent Salary:  $60,000.00 to $80,000.00 /year Experience: Copywriting:  3 years (Preferred) Work Eligibility: The candidate can work permanently with no restriction on hours (Preferred) ",1.0

Located at CSIRO Black Mountain in Canberra
The Role

In this newly created role, you will be reporting to Professor Phil Taylor and working alongside established and successful research scientists at CSIRO, and in particular under the supervision of Dr Peter Brown of CSIRO . As part of this role, you will have the opportunity to build and maintain networks, play a lead role in securing project funds, provide scientific leadership and pursue new ideas and approaches that create new concepts.

Specifically, in this role you will develop and apply genetic tools to understand genetic diversity, dispersal, gene flow and population structure of mouse populations (“landscape genomics”)  to develop robust rodent management recommendations for the grains industry.

This information will: 

lead to a better understanding of mouse movements (identify source and sink habitats to understand when and where to undertake management) ,
inform the design of mouse monitoring systems (spatial layout and timing of monitoring)  and
improve our understanding of mouse ecology (where do mice live, how do they interact with crops, etc) .
In this important role, you will work to connect these different components and generate an entirely new level of understanding of mouse populations and thereby contribute to improved management strategies.

Key Responsibilities include: 
Designing and carrying out population genomics studies to better understand diversity, gene flow, population dynamics, and migration patterns of mice in Australian cropping systems.
Assisting with the experimental design and collection of genetic material. Assist with collection of genetic samples from the field and talking with end-users and stakeholders of this research (growers and the grains industry) .
Undertake experimental and/or observational research activities, often requiring the supervision and/or training of others to ensure experiments are established in accordance with research design, or as required.
Draw on professional expertise, knowledge of other disciplines and research experience, recognise opportunities for innovation and generate new theoretical perspectives by pursuing new ideas/approaches and networking with scientific colleagues across a range of disciplines.
About You

The successful candidate will be Ph D qualified in population genomics or a relevant discipline and have an excellent track record of research in the areas of evolutionary genetics or population genetics. You will have significant experience with analysis of genome sequencing data and high throughput sequencing population genomics data. Coupled with your strong research background and successful record of publications in quality journals, you will possess excellent communication skills and a demonstrated track record of working collaboratively and effectively as part of an interdisciplinary team.

You will have a good understanding of project management in a research context and have a strong track record of engaging with and building strong relationships and linkages with industry partners to meet project milestones.

The platform enables full transparency of program and the ability to effectively plan and coordinate the movement of materials and assets.

Post the roll out of the first version of Veyor's scheduling board on Sydney's tallest residential skyscraper construction in 2018, most of Australia's Tier 1 and 2 building contractors have followed suit and utilise the Veyor platform to improve project materials handling, coordination and efficiency.

627,"Location: Brisbane QLD, Company name: Sterning, Company rating: Not Available, Pay frequency: year, State: QLD, Job Title and Job Description: Account Director One of Brisbane's leading integrated communications businesses and they are looking for highly talented Account Director to join it established team.
Brisbane
$95,000 — $110,000
This is a great opportunity to join one of Australia's finest communications agency and to help direct one if its finest and most loyal clients. You might currently be working as client lead in an integrated, digital or media agency

From brief to final delivery, it is your responsibility to lead the clients and agency team to deliver the very best work which will deliver against the client brief, creating an environment of motivation, inspiration, trust and partnership.

Beyond managing the projects, you should be leading the clients, driving the agency agenda. This is built through a deep strategic partnership with clients, where they always want your point of view because they know you understand their business as well as them. You should always be asking the right questions and doing your homework to ensure you have a robust understanding of the client’s business, its strengths/weaknesses/opportunities/threats, as well the motivations of the clients themselves so you know how to best frame the work.

The Account Director should ensure that the client interaction with the Agency should be the high point of their day, and can leave them feeling stretched, even challenged at times, but always constructively so, based on building to a shared goal not individual disparate agendas.

You should always do what's right for the work and sometimes that means having the difficult conversations - whether that's on the brief, on creative feedback, timings or budget but based on your knowledge of their business and their personal motivations, you know how best to do this and have built up the trust that will make this easier.


Making it happen

You are responsible for the delivery of all projects on brief, on time and in budget - at the very best quality.

You are responsible for ensuring you have access to the right skills to deliver. You should get to know what the Client offering is within the different group capabilities, why it could be relevant to your Client and who the discipline experts are within our those capabilities. Be collaborative to ensure a seamless integration of skills, all working for the same thing - the work.

You are responsible for getting client approval on all aspects of production. That requires thinking ahead, ensuring clients are clear on what needs to happen when and therefore setting the right conditions to drive the agency agenda and getting to the best output.

At Account Director level we expect you to demonstrate a sound strategic understanding and insight into your client’s business, its competitors, the broader category and its customers. You should have a point of view on what is right for their business (not just what the clients want)  bringing a fresh perspective to the table. You should be able to present strategic thinking with clarity, often leading the conversation both internally and with clients. Your planner will not always be in the room, so you should learn not to be overly reliant on them for their point of view.

Some of the desirable skills and experience

Account Directors should be capable at writing good creative briefs for smaller projects, always with an insightful 'did you know' that can frame the challenge.
You should start to lead the longer term view, having a point of view about what the approach should be beyond the current projects in order to deliver against the client's objectives.
You set roles, responsibilities and lead your particular silo team on a day-to-day basis, mentoring and coaching as appropriate. You play an important role in keeping everyone motivated - not only in account management but also planning, creative, data and production.
Inspire high standards throughout – both internally and in all aspects of client service. You should provide positive leadership in all situations, especially the difficult ones.
You ensure you have the flexibility of style between orchestrating, facilitating or driving a team and knowledge of when each style will help to meet the end goal.
Nurture and develop junior talent including performance appraisals and encouraging productive career conversations, including the setting and regular reviews of objectives. This approach should empower the team to become self-aware, self-motivated and inspired to do their very best.
Demonstrate the ability to manage individuals (both senior and junior)  and their workloads to get the best from them.

Join a connected team of professionals, where you can be your authentic self; grow your career while making time for all parts of your life.
The Department of Home Affairs is a central policy agency, providing coordinated strategy and policy leadership for Australia's national and transport security, federal law enforcement, criminal justice, cyber security, border, immigration, multicultural affairs, emergency management and trade related functions.

Overview of the Division: 
The Critical Infrastructure Security Division works across all levels of government, and with critical infrastructure owners and operators to identify and manage risks to Australia’s critical infrastructure. The Division brings together expertise and capability from across the Australian Government to manage the complex and evolving national security risks across all facets of Australia’s critical infrastructure.
The Division is focused on assessing the risks of sabotage, espionage and foreign interference in critical infrastructure sectors such as telecommunications, energy, transport, water, health, banking & finance and food & grocery.
About the Role: 
The Critical Infrastructure Security Division is seeking officers at the APS5 and APS6 levels to fill vacancies across a variety of policy, risk, regulatory and analytical roles related to the security and resilience of Australia’s critical infrastructure.
Opportunities exist to not only contribute to work on the development and implementation of national security policy advice related to the critical infrastructure sectors of telecommunications, energy, transport, health, water, food & grocery and banking & finance, but also to support the implementation of legislation designed to safeguard Australia’s critical infrastructure and ongoing regulation of certain critical infrastructure entities.
Other roles will see the successful applicants develop national security risk advice ultimately provided to the Foreign Investment Review Board and the Treasurer, or made under delegated powers under the Telecommunications Sector Security Reforms.
Regulatory roles support the division’s regulatory function in critical infrastructure sectors in an evolving risk-based regulation environment, including supporting the implementation of an assurance program and ensuring compliance with recently introduced legislation.
Finally there are roles available in the Critical Infrastructure Program for Modelling and Analysis (CIPMA) , a small multidisciplinary team of scientists, analysts and researchers which provides crucial support to all aspects of the work of the Division.

The successful regulatory candidates will demonstrate experience in delivering a range of regulatory and assurance activities, including managing compliance casework.
The successful analytical candidates may come from a range of backgrounds as CIPMA officers use a wide array of techniques to understand the behaviour of critical infrastructure systems and how they interrelate. This could include – but is not limited to - experience with data mining, integration and visualisation techniques or geographic information systems.
Candidates are encouraged to identify relevant experience and abilities across multiple areas of interest.

We trust in, trust and care about our people. We create a fulfilling, flexible and supportive workplace that helps our people achieve their goals. We invest in the tools, systems and training our people need to do their jobs.
The department supports workplace diversity and values the contribution of people from diverse backgrounds. We encourage applications from Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander peoples, people with disability, people with cultural and linguistic diversity, and LGBTIQ people. The department is committed to achieving gender equality and, in particular, supporting women’s progression into senior leadership.
A little bit about us
The Strategic Policy Branch is the central policy hub within the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Cities & Regional Development, advising key Ministers and the Department’s Senior Executive Board on whole-of-Department Policy priorities. The Strategic Policy Branch function has three arms – a Departmental Strategy Unit, a Policy Project Unit and a Cities and Infrastructure Economic Policy Unit.
The opportunities we have available
APS5, APS6 and EL1 Cities, Infrastructure and Population - Economic policy
We are seeking outstanding public economists who want to be involved in the development of national cities, transport, infrastructure and regional policy within the Australian Government. We are flexible about the level. In the end, we want the best people and we will adjust the role and level to accommodate the person (not the other way around) .
What will you do?
You will be developing policy advice end-to-end – from economic theory to evidence to sharp written advice and visuals. Your work begins with consideration of the economic framework that underpins the policy area (e.g. cities, housing, infrastructure, transport etc) . Next you will marshal the evidence, including analysing relevant data and drawing on relevant research. You will also consult and learn from experts in the policy area before presenting your findings and recommendations at our economic policy forums. These are an opportunity for the team to test ideas and bring their skills to bear on interesting policy questions. Finally, you will draft written advice for Ministers including charts and other visuals.
The role provides an opportunity to learn the following skills: 
High level economic theory and its application to real world policy advice
Analysing economic data to support policy change
Verbal presentation skills and the capability to create compelling visuals
Economic writing, including writing with precision about quantitative or economic concepts
Engagement with expert networks for input, advice and assistance across the Department and broader Commonwealth Government.
Who are we looking for?

The following core capabilities are key to this role: 

Intellectual Curiosity – you need to be analytical and empirical in your thinking and apply an economic framework to your policy advice. We will help you get the tools, but you need the intellectual curiosity and discipline to get results.
Relentless pursuit of human capital - you need to be focussed and disciplined to master economics, analysis and policy advising. We will give you the opportunity to acquire the needed skills and human capital, but you need to put in the effort.
A love of sharp communication – you need to be able to convey your logic and evidence clearly and succinctly. Our end product is policy advice; it needs to be short, sharp and persuasive. That means honing your writing, your presenting and your visuals. We take the look, feel and style of our advisory products seriously, not just the economic content.
Acts with integrity – you need to engage with stakeholders in good faith, always do your best and take a genuine interest in helping out in the team. The team will also be there for you when you need it.
Eligibility requirements

The onsite PC technician is the forefront of representation for technical services to the customer.
