The University of Melbourne led Consortium, consisting of the Alfred, the Burnet, MCRI, the Doherty and Melbourne School of Population and Global Health (University of Melbourne) has been tasked with hosting the VPHMTS for 5 years of intakes. Each year of the intake 2 VPHMTS trainees (public health medicine registrars) each year who will each be employed for a duration of three years. The consortium provides a comprehensive training program for public health medicine registrars to become public health physicians. A range of work placements cover the range of competencies as set out in the AFPHM Program Requirements Handbook. In addition, the location of work placements must comply with the requirements for accreditation and for maintaining their accreditation status with AFPHM.

The Melbourne Consortium will provide leadership and professional development activities for the VPHMTS trainees.

In addition, the VPHMTS structure and competency framework makes graduates highly sought after as experienced and flexible public health professionals with the capacity and skills to manage a broad range of public health areas within the priorities of the Victorian health system.

There are 3 levels of supervisory involvement:

The Melbourne Consortium Host institution will allot a training supervisor to oversee the 3-year experience
Each placement will be undertaken under the guidance of local skilled supervisor
The learning experience will also be scaffolded by the requirements of the AFPHM Advanced Training Program as per the RACP AFPHM Program Requirements Handbook. This includes the requirements for supervisors, the use of learning contracts for each placement and the requirements to assess the development of competency and progression to Fellowship of the Faculty.
In year two (2020) The MSPGH and the Doherty will host the 2 VPHMTS trainees. They will each appoint one trainee who will be employed with this host for the duration of the 3 years training and will be seconded out to placements at other host institutions:

Year one (2019): 2 x six month placements associated with their host (negotiated).
Year two (2020): 2 x six month placements at DHHS.
Year three (2021):
One six month placement at the Doherty or Melbourne School of Population and Global Health (negotiated).
One six month placement external to the host institution (negotiated)
Trainees are required to fulfill management and organisational responsibilities which are also linked to competency attainment; these may include preparing briefings, chairing meetings, running a community forum or representing a work program at a public/community/stakeholder forum, media interviews (real or mock), or site visits/inspections/audits. There will be training opportunities that the Trainees themselves will help organise, such as running a journal club or a teaching session.

As the Internet of Things (IoT) grows more prominent, and technology becomes ever more embedded in everyday life, the challenge becomes more pressing to ensure that this technological revolution is harnessed in ways that enhance liveability as much as possible. Monash University, in collaboration with Monash City Council, aims to be a part of the solution, with iSense Oakleigh – an integrated smart city precinct underpinned by advanced sensoring technologies and a data communications network.

This is an incredibly exciting project using existing technology in a new way. The network provides an IoT connected platform to sense, collect and analyse relevant data to improve liveability for the community within the precinct. The sensors and its platform will collect and fuse different data on mobility including vehicles, bicycles and pedestrians, as well as improve utilisation of public spaces such as on-street and off-street parking. Once captured, this data will be used in practical applications that will increase levels of service and efficiency, and ultimately greatly enhance the community.

The Research Fellow will focus on researching and creating novel prototype software to support the project. This will include working with the Chief Investigators Professor John Grundy and Professor Hai Vu; the Solution Architect; the technology providers; and MCC staff; to identify new council employee, business organisation and/or citizen digital solution requirements and designs, and help to identify and assess potential architectures and platforms that could be used for project solutions. These solution designs will:

Leverage the iSense Oakleigh smart city sensors, interactors, platform and data
Prototype solutions that fuse available smart city data to support traffic management, pedestrians, businesses and council operations
Use data analytics to find and understand patterns and amalgamate diverse sensor data; and
Present this information and knowledge obtained to end users in visual forms using mobile apps and/or web pages

121,Research Fellow - AiLECS,Caulfield VIC,,Monash University,4.099999904632568,"$97,203 - $115,429 a year","The Opportunity

Technology is an ever-more central and ubiquitous part the human experience, and it constantly changes the way we live our lives, for better or worse. One of the highest priorities of the Monash University’s fast-growing, world-class Faculty of IT is to consistently be at the forefront of innovative research into how technology can be used for good social outcomes.

As part of this ongoing mission, the newly launched Artificial Intelligence for Law Enforcement and Community Safety (AiLECS) research lab is proud to announce an opening for a committed and dedicated Research Fellow to join our expanding team!

The AiLECS lab is a joint initiative of Monash University and the Australian Federal Police, and we investigate how the ethical use of AI and machine learning can assist with accelerating the investigation and prosecution of heinous crimes such as child exploitation and terrorism. This is an incredibly important research area, as exposure to the material associated with such areas can cause significant psychological trauma for police officers and the judiciary.

The Australian-first AiLECS lab focuses on:

Explainable algorithms and auditable performance techniques (important for judicial use and public accountability)
Illicit image and video machine learning classification algorithms
Image localisation
Scalable near duplicate image detection techniques
Techniques for leveraging massive law enforcement datasets
A crucial part of this work has been access to real case data for training machine learning algorithms. Due to its illegal and disturbing nature, a “data airlock” server architecture has been developed in the lab allowing tightly controlled access in such a way that researchers can train algorithms without being exposed to the raw data.

Watch how this research creates better social outcomes.

About you:

We are seeking an outstanding qualified researcher to join our team. Ideally you will have worked in machine learning with deep neural networks for image classification or other relevant experience. The AiLECS lab has a focus on the rapid operationalisation of research work into technologies for integration with law enforcement systems. There is also a strong emphasis in the lab on international collaboration.

Additionally, any experience with the following will be highly regarded:

Machine learning (image classification a bonus!)
Extensive coding experience (particularly Python/.NET Core)
A focus on applied research
If you are enthusiastic at the prospect of taking on an important and ground-breaking challenge that does demonstrable social good, we strongly encourage you to apply!

Work Environment
The role of the Australian Department of Agriculture is to develop and implement policies and programs that ensure Australia's agricultural, fisheries, food and forestry industries remain competitive, profitable and sustainable. As part of this, the department safeguards Australia’s animal and plant health status to maintain overseas markets and protect the economy and environment from the impact of exotic pests and diseases through risk assessment, inspection and certification, and the implementation of emergency response arrangements for Australian agricultural, food and fibre industries.

The Veterinary and Export Meat Group (VEMG) undertakes regulatory functions by providing inspection and certification for the export of meat, meat products and the import and export of live animals and reproductive material in order to meet importing country requirements and Australian legislative requirement.

Once the budget allocation is defined, it then proceeds to tactical deployment of funds across the selected channels to ensure target market optimisation to set the stage for everything that follows.The second act is to create design elements specifically tailored to each of the channels to ensure optimal conversions while providing coherent maximum brand reinforcement. The collaboration and synchronisation of media and creative design is one of the reasons UEC out-performs its peers as well as internal marketing departments.The third act builds on this momentum to integrate lead generation and client acquisition activities to feed into a cohesive customer journey that provides a higher conversion on their path to purchase. This is enabled with sophisticated automated workflows that create and enhance the customer experience, reducing attrition at or immediately following a purchase as well as substantially improving customer satisfaction during the consumption of the product or service. This inevitably reduces operational costs. Even though UEC is focused on media, sales and marketing, the systemisation of multiple customer journeys translates into organisational improvements that further create benefits with economies of scale.

The appointment will be commensurate with experience.
Appointment Type: 3 year fixed term, full-time (possibility of extension)
Located at CSIRO Black Mountain in Canberra
The Role

In this newly created role, you will be reporting to Professor Phil Taylor and working alongside established and successful research scientists at CSIRO, and in particular under the supervision of Dr Peter Brown of CSIRO . As part of this role, you will have the opportunity to build and maintain networks, play a lead role in securing project funds, provide scientific leadership and pursue new ideas and approaches that create new concepts.

Specifically, in this role you will develop and apply genetic tools to understand genetic diversity, dispersal, gene flow and population structure of mouse populations (“landscape genomics”) to develop robust rodent management recommendations for the grains industry.

This information will:

lead to a better understanding of mouse movements (identify source and sink habitats to understand when and where to undertake management),
inform the design of mouse monitoring systems (spatial layout and timing of monitoring) and
improve our understanding of mouse ecology (where do mice live, how do they interact with crops, etc).
In this important role, you will work to connect these different components and generate an entirely new level of understanding of mouse populations and thereby contribute to improved management strategies.

Key Responsibilities include:
Designing and carrying out population genomics studies to better understand diversity, gene flow, population dynamics, and migration patterns of mice in Australian cropping systems.
Assisting with the experimental design and collection of genetic material. Assist with collection of genetic samples from the field and talking with end-users and stakeholders of this research (growers and the grains industry).
Undertake experimental and/or observational research activities, often requiring the supervision and/or training of others to ensure experiments are established in accordance with research design, or as required.
Draw on professional expertise, knowledge of other disciplines and research experience, recognise opportunities for innovation and generate new theoretical perspectives by pursuing new ideas/approaches and networking with scientific colleagues across a range of disciplines.
About You

The successful candidate will be PhD qualified in population genomics or a relevant discipline and have an excellent track record of research in the areas of evolutionary genetics or population genetics. You will have significant experience with analysis of genome sequencing data and high throughput sequencing population genomics data. Coupled with your strong research background and successful record of publications in quality journals, you will possess excellent communication skills and a demonstrated track record of working collaboratively and effectively as part of an interdisciplinary team.

You will have a good understanding of project management in a research context and have a strong track record of engaging with and building strong relationships and linkages with industry partners to meet project milestones.
